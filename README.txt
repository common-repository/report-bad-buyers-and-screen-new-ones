Sellers report bad buyers who made unreasonable demands, gave unfair feedback, misused returns, refused a delivery, disputed a charge ...etc. and internally build and share a large database of rated buyers. Sellers report bad buyers because they believe they have been treated unfairly and often neglected by third parties such as eBay, Amazon, … etc..  They also want bad buyers to be held accountable for their actions by bringing publicity to their experiences.  Sellers can notify the bad buyer of their report and be able to resolve an issue with that bad buyer.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can sellers benefit from eBuyersReviewed? =

E-commerce often makes it a little too easy for good people to behave badly.  When those good people are your customers, those consequences can be excruciating and expensive. Online retailers live in justifiable fear that a couple of complaints, false reviews, or fraudulent payment disputes going viral could irreparably damage their business.  Our objective here is to create symmetry of accountability and transparency between parties.  We offer online sellers an equal opportunity to review their buyers, the same way buyers review sellers, and to share those reviews among each other.  The ultimate goal is to enable businesses to protect themselves in order to improve their bottom line.  Reporting buyers is a powerful tool for creating a sense of accountability among buyers as well as helping other sellers.

= How does eBuyersReviewed work? =

We offer members (membership is FREE) an opportunity to submit reviews on their buyers, as well as read reviews submitted by other sellers.  Reviewers assign a risk level to their reviewed buyers on a scale of 1 to 5.  A tracking number is required for each review as proof of delivery.  Tracking numbers are internally checked for authenticity.  A seller can review a buyer and edit his/her review only once.

= Should I be concerned about voicing my opinion on my buyers? =

The right of verbal expression of thoughts and opinions before a voluntary audience is stated in the First Amendment to the Constitution and is protected by the law. "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances." -First Amendment to the Constitution. 

However, using false information, foul language or threats, which may harm an individual or an institution can be used against you in the court of law.

= Is it OK to include the buyer's name and address in a review? =

The information required for a review, such as the buyer's name and address, is considered a public domain and is generally available in various public records, white pages, etc. We would never ask for private information such as a Social Security Number, Credit Card Data, Passport ID Number, Driver License Number, Date of Birth.

= Is eBuyersReviewed free? =

Our Basic membership is absolutely free of charge. However, the more popular Premium membership and Corporate membership, offering advanced features for frequent users, are available on a paid membership basis.

= Can I remain anonymous when submitting a review? =

Before submitting a review, you can choose not to have your name shown on the review, and not to be contacted by other members.  Alternatively, you can have your first name and last name initial displayed and allow other members to contact you. Your e-mail, however, always remains private.

= Should I notify the buyer that I have submitted a review on him/her? =

Each review can be of great benefit to other sellers using this site, but it could also provide a powerful tool to the seller submitting it. If you have received an undeserved negative feedback or have been dealt with unfairly, you may contact the buyer and inform him/her of your intent to submit a negative report with us. Our practice shows that bad buyers, who know that their online reputation can be damaged for a legitimate reason, are more likely to be more cooperative than those who feel that they can run away with no consequences. When you notify your buyer of a submitted report always be professional and reasonable with your requests.
